This project will have a user add recipes to a social media website to share and save recipes so they can use in their cooking. My inspiration for this project is that my dad is a chef and he has a ton of recipes that would be great to share with a community that loves to cook.

technologies:

Node
Express
React
Mongo
Mongoose
Axios
